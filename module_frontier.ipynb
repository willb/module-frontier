    "_Sound_ program analyses present conservative overapproximations of program behavior.  Consider a _may-alias analysis_, which determines if two reference variables may refer to the same location in memory.  Precise may-alias analysis is undecidable, but certain kinds of imprecision are acceptable.  Often we're interested in sound analyses to support verification or semantics-preserving program transformations, so false positives are acceptable but false negatives are not.  Put another way, the worst that can come of spuriously identifying a pair of variables as potentially-aliasing is that we'd miss an opportunity to optimize our program; the worst that can come of not identifying a pair of potentially-aliasing variables as such is a program tranformation that introduces a behavior change.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, _unsound_ analyses are imprecise but not conservative:  both false positives and false negatives are possible.  These analyses are still useful for program understanding (e.g., in linters or static bug detectors) even if they are not sufficient to support program transformations.  In this post (which is also available as an interactive notebook), we'll develop an unsound analysis for Python.  The goal of the analysis we'll develop is to identify which modules a function depends on; this post will show one way to build up such a technique.  \n",

    "Consider the following problem:  you'd like to enable users to automatically extract a function from a Jupyter notebook and publish it as a service.  Actually serializing a closure from a function in a given environment is not difficult, given the [`cloudpickle`](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) module.  But merely constructing a serialized closure isn't enough, since in general this function may require other modules to be available to run in another context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need some way to identify the modules required by a function (and, ideally, the packages that provide these modules).  Since engineering time is limited, it's probably better to have an optimistic-and-imperfect estimate and allow users to override it (by supplying additional dependencies when they publish a function) than it is to have a sound and conservative module list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`modulefinder`](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/modulefinder.html) module in the Python standard library might initially seem like an attractive option, but it is unsuitable because it operates at the level of scripts.  In order to use `modulefinder` on a single function from a notebook, we'd either have an imprecise module list (due to running the whole notebook) or we'd need to essentially duplicate a lot of its effort in order to [slice backwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_slicing) from the function invocation so we could extract a suitably pruned script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, you can interrogate nearly any aspect of any object in a Python program, and functions are no exception.  If we could inspect the captured variables in a closure, we could identify the ones that are functions and figure out which modules they were declared in.  That would look something like this:"

In the above function, we're constructing a worklist of all of the captured variables in a given function's closure.  We're then constructing a set of all of the modules directly or transitively referred to by those captured variables, whether these are modules referred to directly, modules declaring functions referred to by captured variables, or modules declaring other values referred to by captured variables (e.g., native functions).
